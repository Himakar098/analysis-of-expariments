Ques 1:
Based on your request to analyze the relationship between air pollution and mortality, we've already conducted the initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) with the following insights:

1. **Climate Variables vs. Mortality**:
   - This plot shows weak correlations between climate variables (Precipitation, Humidity, January Temperature, July Temperature) and mortality, suggesting that climate alone might not be a strong predictor of mortality rates.

2. **Socioeconomic Variables vs. Mortality**:
   - Socioeconomic factors including the percentage of the population over 65, population per household, median education years, and population density exhibit varying degrees of correlation with mortality rates. Variables like education levels and household population density could potentially influence mortality, indicating the need for further detailed regression analysis to understand these impacts better.

3. **Pollution Variables vs. Mortality**:
   - Pollution variables (Hydrocarbons, Oxides of Nitrogen, Sulphur Dioxide) show potential correlations where higher levels of pollutants might be associated with increased mortality rates. This suggests a direct inquiry into pollution effects is necessary, adjusting for other socioeconomic and climate variables.

4. **Mortality by Region**:
   - Mortality rates appear to vary significantly across regions, which might reflect underlying differences in environmental policies, access to healthcare, lifestyle, or even unmeasured pollution levels.

These findings from the EDA are crucial as they guide the deeper investigation into how pollution specifically impacts mortality, controlling for socioeconomic and climate factors. Next, we can progress into regression analysis to model these relationships more formally and perform statistical tests to determine the significance and strength of pollution's impact on mortality. 
```{r}


```

To proceed with the analysis, we'll outline the steps you would follow in R to perform regression analysis on your dataset. This will involve:

1. **Model Selection**:
   - We'll use an all subsets regression method to identify the best-fitting model based on criteria such as adjusted R-squared, Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and Cp.

2. **Fit the Optimal Model**:
   - Once the best model is selected, we'll fit the regression model and analyze its coefficients.

3. **Model Diagnostics**:
   - Perform diagnostic checks to ensure the model meets the assumptions of linear regression.

4. **Testing Pollution Variables' Impact**:
   - Adding pollution variables to the model and conducting an F-test to assess their significance.

### R Code for Each Step

#### Step 1: Model Selection
```r
library(leaps)
library(MASS)

# Load your data
data <- read.csv("Pollution.csv")

# All subsets regression with a limit on the number of variables
fit <- regsubsets(Mortality ~ Over65 + House + Educ + Sound + Density + NonWhite + WhiteCol + Poor + Precip + Humidity + JanTemp + JulyTemp + HC + NOX + SO2, data=data, nbest=1, nvmax=10, method="exhaustive")

# View the summary of the best models
summary(fit)

# Plotting the models based on BIC, Adjusted R-squared, and Cp
plot(fit, scale="bic")
plot(fit, scale="adjr2")
plot(fit, scale="Cp")
```

#### Step 2: Fit the Optimal Model
```r
# Assuming the best model includes certain variables based on previous step
model <- lm(Mortality ~ Over65 + Educ + HC + NOX + SO2, data=data)
summary(model)
```

#### Step 3: Model Diagnostics
```r
# Checking for assumptions: linearity, normality, and homoscedasticity
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(model)
```

#### Step 4: Testing Pollution Variables' Impact
```r
# Add pollution variables to a base model and perform an F-test
base_model <- lm(Mortality ~ Over65 + Educ, data=data)
pollution_model <- update(base_model, .~. + log(HC) + log(NOX) + log(SO2))

# F-test
anova(base_model, pollution_model)
```

This sequence of R code will help you to conduct a thorough analysis of how air pollution impacts mortality, adjusting for other variables in your dataset. Make sure you tailor the variable selection and modeling steps according to the specific results and needs of your dataset analysis.


b---

For part (b) of your assignment, where you need to perform model selection using the All Subset method, you can use R and the `leaps` package, which is commonly used for this purpose. The aim here is to find a set of models that best explain the variation in mortality due to climate and socioeconomic factors. We will examine models up to a subset size of 10 variables and identify the optimal models using adjusted R², BIC, and Mallows' Cp.

Here’s how you would proceed in R to perform this model selection process:

### R Code for Model Selection Using All Subsets Method

```r
library(leaps)
library(MASS)  # For additional regression tools

# Assuming data has been loaded and is named 'data'
data <- read.csv("Pollution.csv")

# Define the full model including all predictors
full_model <- Mortality ~ Over65 + House + Educ + Sound + Density + NonWhite + WhiteCol + Poor + Precip + Humidity + JanTemp + JulyTemp + HC + NOX + SO2

# Perform all subsets regression
subsets_result <- regsubsets(full_model, data=data, nvmax=10, nbest=1, method="exhaustive")

# Summarize the results
subsets_summary <- summary(subsets_result)

# Extracting the statistics
adjr2 <- subsets_summary$adjr2
bic <- subsets_summary$bic
cp <- subsets_summary$cp

# Identify the best model by Adjusted R-squared, BIC, and Cp
best_adjr2 <- which.max(adjr2)
best_bic <- which.min(bic)
best_cp <- which.min(cp)

# Output for best models based on each criterion
cat("Best Model by Adjusted R-squared includes", best_adjr2, "variables\n")
cat("Best Model by BIC includes", best_bic, "variables\n")
cat("Best Model by Cp includes", best_cp, "variables\n")

# Plot the model selection criteria
plot(subsets_result, scale="r2")
plot(subsets_result, scale="bic")
plot(subsets_result, scale="Cp")
```

### Explanation and Interpretation

1. **Model Selection Plot**: The plots generated from the last part of the script visually present how each of the selection criteria (adjusted R², BIC, Cp) changes with different model sizes. You typically look for the highest adjusted R², the lowest BIC, and the lowest Cp to determine the best model.

2. **Output Interpretation**:
   - **Adjusted R²**: The model with the highest adjusted R² uses the number of variables indicated by `best_adjr2`. This model balances complexity and fit, making it effective for prediction.
   - **BIC**: The model with the lowest BIC, indicated by `best_bic`, suggests a model that is good at avoiding overfitting while still fitting the data well.
   - **Cp**: Mallows' Cp, indicated by `best_cp`, helps identify the model with the best trade-off between complexity and fit to the data.

Make sure to adjust the output to match the specific names and number of variables in the best models found in your analysis, and then discuss the results based on the statistical output and the plots. This step is crucial for interpreting which factors are most influential in explaining the variations in mortality across different cities, focusing on climate and socioeconomic differences without yet considering pollution factors.


c--- 
For part (c), after identifying the model with the lowest Mallows' Cp using the All Subset method in R, the next step is to fit that optimal model and write down the equation. I'll guide you through the steps to fit this model and then discuss how to write and interpret the model equation.

### R Code to Fit the Optimal Model and Write the Equation
Let's assume from part (b) you found that the best model based on Mallows' Cp includes certain variables, which we'll specify here. Here's how you would proceed:

```r
# Assuming the selected variables based on lowest Cp are as follows (for example):
# Mortality ~ Educ + WhiteCol + Density + HC + NOX

# Fitting the optimal model
optimal_model <- lm(Mortality ~ Educ + WhiteCol + Density + HC + NOX, data=data)

# Summary of the model to check coefficients and model statistics
summary(optimal_model)

# Extract coefficients for interpretation
coefficients(optimal_model)
```

### Writing the Equation of the Fitted Model
Suppose the output of your model provides the following coefficients (note: these values are illustrative and will differ based on your actual analysis):

- Intercept = 750
- Educ = -20 (Coefficient for years of education)
- WhiteCol = 5 (Coefficient for percentage in white-collar jobs)
- Density = 0.03 (Coefficient for population density)
- HC = 0.5 (Coefficient for hydrocarbons)
- NOX = 0.7 (Coefficient for oxides of nitrogen)

The regression equation would then be:
\[ \text{Mortality} = 750 - 20 \times \text{Educ} + 5 \times \text{WhiteCol} + 0.03 \times \text{Density} + 0.5 \times \text{HC} + 0.7 \times \text{NOX} \]

### Interpretation of the Model
- **Intercept (750)**: Represents the estimated mortality rate per 100,000 population when all predictors are zero (which is not realistic in this context but serves as a baseline in the regression equation).
- **Educ (-20)**: Suggests that each additional year of median education completed is associated with a decrease of 20 deaths per 100,000 population, indicating that higher education levels may contribute to better health outcomes.
- **WhiteCol (5)**: Indicates that each percentage increase in white-collar employment is associated with an increase of 5 deaths per 100,000 population. This might seem counterintuitive and could warrant further investigation into the nature of these jobs or other associated socioeconomic factors.
- **Density (0.03)**: Shows a slight increase in mortality with increasing population density, potentially reflecting the effects of urbanization such as pollution and lifestyle factors on health.
- **HC (0.5) and NOX (0.7)**: Both coefficients suggest that increases in the pollution levels of hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen are associated with increases in mortality rates, directly linking higher pollution to worse health outcomes.

This interpretation should discuss how each variable might realistically affect mortality, considering potential confounders and the socio-economic context of the regions studied. Further investigation into each relationship, especially unexpected ones like that of white-collar employment, may reveal deeper insights or suggest areas for policy intervention.


d---

For part (d), performing diagnostic checks on the regression model is critical to ensure that the model is valid and that the assumptions of linear regression are met. These checks include analyzing residuals, identifying outliers, and assessing influence points like leverage and Cook's distance. Let’s outline the R code to execute these diagnostics and then interpret the findings, specifically identifying influential cities based on high leverage and Cook’s distance.

### R Code for Diagnostics Checking
Here’s how you could execute the diagnostics for the model:

```r
# Assuming 'optimal_model' is your fitted regression model from part (c)
library(car)  # for additional diagnostic plots

# Setting up the plot window to display multiple plots
par(mfrow=c(2,2))

# Plot standard diagnostic plots
plot(optimal_model)

# Additional diagnostic plot for Cook's distance
plot(cooks.distance(optimal_model), type="h", main="Cook's Distance", ylab="Cook's Distance")
abline(h=4/(nrow(data)-length(coef(optimal_model))), col="red")  # threshold line

# Reset plot settings to default
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
```

### Explanation of the Diagnostic Plots
1. **Residuals vs Fitted**: Checks for non-linearity, unequal error variances, and outliers. Residuals should be randomly dispersed around the horizontal axis (0 line).
2. **Normal Q-Q Plot**: Assesses whether the residuals are normally distributed; points should closely follow the reference line.
3. **Scale-Location (or Spread-Location) Plot**: Tests homoscedasticity, showing if residuals are spread equally across the range of predictors.
4. **Residual vs Leverage Plot**: Helps to identify influential cases. Points with high leverage that deviate from the pattern of other points could be influential.

### Identifying Influential Points
- **Leverage**: High-leverage points have greater potential to influence the regression line. A common rule of thumb is that a data point has high leverage if its leverage value is more than \(2 \times \frac{p + 1}{n}\), where \(p\) is the number of predictors and \(n\) is the number of observations.
- **Cook's Distance**: Measures the effect of deleting a data point. Points with a Cook’s distance larger than \( \frac{4}{n-p-1} \) are considered influential.

### R Code to Identify Cities with High Influence
```r
# Calculating leverage and identifying high leverage points
leverage_values <- hatvalues(optimal_model)
high_leverage_points <- which(leverage_values > 2*(length(coef(optimal_model))+1)/nrow(data))

# Calculating Cook's Distance and identifying influential points
cooks_values <- cooks.distance(optimal_model)
influential_points <- which(cooks_values > 4/(nrow(data)-length(coef(optimal_model))))

# Extracting city names for high influence points
data$City[high_leverage_points]
data$City[influential_points]
```

### Results and Comment
- After running the above code, you would get the names of the cities that are considered high leverage or have high Cook's distance. This insight can be crucial, especially if policy interventions or further detailed studies are considered for these regions.
- The interpretation should include a discussion on why these points might be influential (e.g., extreme values of predictors, errors in data collection, unique economic or environmental conditions) and how they could potentially skew the results of the analysis.

This diagnostic checking ensures that the conclusions drawn from the regression analysis are robust and credible, addressing any concerns about data quality or model fit before making policy recommendations or further interpretations.


e---- 

In part (e) of your assignment, we need to test the impact of adding the logarithmic transformations of the three pollution variables (HC, NOX, SO2) to the previously selected optimal model and conduct an extra-sum-of-squares F-test. This test will help us understand whether the inclusion of these pollution variables significantly improves the model in terms of explaining the variability in mortality rates.

### R Code for Adding Pollution Variables and Conducting the F-test

First, let's write the R code that includes adding the transformed pollution variables to your existing model and then performing the F-test.

```r
# Assuming 'optimal_model' is your previously fitted model without pollution variables
library(car)  # for the 'Anova' function

# Fit the extended model with the log-transformed pollution variables
extended_model <- update(optimal_model, . ~ . + log(HC) + log(NOX) + log(SO2))

# Conduct an extra-sum-of-squares F-test
anova_results <- anova(optimal_model, extended_model)
print(anova_results)

# Extract the p-value to test the significance of the added pollution variables
p_value <- anova_results$"Pr(>F)"[2]
print(p_value)
```

### Explanation and Interpretation

- **Model Update**: The `update()` function is used to add the natural logarithm of the pollution variables (HC, NOX, SO2) to the existing model. The logarithmic transformation is typically used to handle non-linearity and reduce the effect of outliers.
- **F-test**: The F-test assesses whether the extra predictors (log-transformed pollution variables) provide a statistically significant improvement in the fit of the model compared to the original model. The test compares the residual sum of squares between the models with and without the additional variables, adjusted for the degrees of freedom.

### Results and Comment
- **P-value Interpretation**: The critical output from this process is the p-value from the F-test. If this p-value is less than a typical significance level (e.g., 0.05), you conclude that the pollution variables significantly improve the model's ability to predict mortality.
- **Summary of Findings**: Depending on the p-value:
  - If significant, it indicates that pollution levels (as measured by HC, NOX, and SO2) have a significant effect on mortality rates when controlling for other factors in your model. This would suggest that policies aimed at reducing pollution could have a measurable impact on improving public health.
  - If not significant, it suggests that within the context of the other variables in the model, pollution levels do not add significant explanatory power. This could imply that other factors already included in the model (such as socioeconomic or demographic variables) might be capturing most of the variability in mortality rates.

This part of the analysis crucially supports or refutes the hypothesis that air pollution has a measurable impact on mortality, taking into account other regional and demographic factors.


ques 2:

For Question 2, part (a), we will start by conducting an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the `body.csv` dataset, which includes various body measurements along with age, height, and gender. The goal of the EDA is to understand the distributions, relationships, and potential patterns in the dataset that could inform subsequent modeling efforts.

Let's begin by loading the dataset, examining its structure, and generating a couple of plots for the EDA:

1. **Distribution of `Weight`**: Understanding how weight is distributed across the sample.
2. **Relationship between `Weight` and a couple of key measurements**: Such as `Height` and another measurement from the girth measurements that may have a strong correlation with weight.
3. **Gender Differences**: Analyzing how measurements may differ by gender, which could reveal important biometric distinctions.

I will proceed with these steps now.

The dataset `body.csv` contains 507 observations with 26 columns. It includes various measurements such as diameters, depths, girths, and general body measurements, along with `Age`, `Weight`, `Height`, and `Gender` (1 for male and 0 for female).

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
We will now generate two plots for the EDA:

1. **Histogram of Weight**: This will help us understand the distribution of weights across the sample.
2. **Box Plot of Weight by Gender**: This will provide insight into differences in weight distribution between genders, which could be crucial for subsequent analyses.

Let's create these plots.

### Interpretation of EDA Plots

1. **Histogram of Weight**:
   - The weight distribution appears roughly symmetric with a slight right skew, indicating that most individuals cluster around a central weight, with fewer individuals at the higher weight extremes. This could suggest a generally healthy population or could reflect demographic factors such as age or gender composition.

2. **Box Plot of Weight by Gender**:
   - There is a noticeable difference in weight distribution between genders. Males (1) tend to weigh more than females (0), with a higher median weight and a wider interquartile range. This is consistent with general biological differences in body composition between males and females.

These insights provide a foundational understanding of how weight varies within this dataset, influenced by factors like gender. Such observations are essential for guiding more detailed statistical modeling and analysis, where factors like gender can be crucial covariates or confounders to control for when modeling the relationship between body measurements and weight. 

If you need further analysis or more specific plots as part of your exploratory data analysis, feel free to let me know!

Certainly! To carry out the same exploratory data analysis (EDA) in R as I demonstrated with Python, you can use the `ggplot2` package for visualization. Below is the R code to create a histogram of `Weight` and a box plot of `Weight` by `Gender`.

### R Code for EDA

```r
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)

# Load the data
body_data <- read_csv("path_to_your_data/body.csv")

# Histogram of Weight
ggplot(body_data, aes(x = Weight)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill = "blue", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Histogram of Weight", x = "Weight (kg)", y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()

# Box Plot of Weight by Gender
ggplot(body_data, aes(x = as.factor(Gender), y = Weight, fill = as.factor(Gender))) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Box Plot of Weight by Gender", x = "Gender (0: Female, 1: Male)", y = "Weight (kg)") +
  scale_fill_discrete(name = "Gender", labels = c("Female", "Male")) +
  theme_minimal()

# You may need to adjust the path to your data file accordingly in the read_csv function.
```

### Explanation:
1. **Histogram of Weight**: The `geom_histogram()` function is used to create histograms. The `bins` parameter controls the number of bins.
2. **Box Plot of Weight by Gender**: The `geom_boxplot()` function is used to create box plots. The `fill` parameter inside `aes()` colors the box plot by gender, enhancing visual distinction.

Ensure you install and load the `ggplot2` package, which is part of the `tidyverse`, and `readr` for reading the CSV file. This code will provide a clear visual representation of the distribution of weights and the comparison of weights between genders, similar to the Python analysis previously described. Adjust the path to your dataset as needed when you run the code in your R environment.


b---- 

For part (b), after having conducted an exploratory analysis, we'll split the dataset into a training and a testing set, and then use these to construct two separate multiple linear regression models using forward and backward variable selection methods. Here's how you can perform these steps in R, including setting the seed for reproducibility and ensuring the models use a 5% significance level for variable selection.

### R Code to Split Data and Construct Models

```r
# Load necessary libraries
library(caret)   # for data splitting
library(MASS)    # for linear models
library(dplyr)   # for data manipulation

# Set the seed for reproducibility
set.seed(2401)

# Load the dataset
body_data <- read_csv("path_to_your_data/body.csv")

# Splitting the data into training and testing sets (80% training, 20% testing)
split <- createDataPartition(body_data$Weight, p = 0.80, list = FALSE)
training <- body_data[split, ]
testing <- body_data[-split, ]

# Model 1: Forward Selection
forward_model <- stepAIC(lm(Weight ~ 1, data = training), 
                         scope = list(lower = formula(Weight ~ 1), 
                                      upper = formula(Weight ~ .)),
                         direction = "forward", trace = FALSE)

# Model 2: Backward Selection
full_model <- lm(Weight ~ ., data = training)
backward_model <- stepAIC(full_model, direction = "backward", trace = FALSE)

# Summarize both models
summary(forward_model)
summary(backward_model)
```

### Explanation and Output Interpretation
- **Data Splitting**: The `createDataPartition` function from the `caret` package is used to split the dataset into training and testing sets. The proportion `p = 0.80` ensures 80% of the data is used for training.
- **Variable Selection**:
  - **Forward Selection**: Starts with a model including only the intercept (no predictors) and adds variables one at a time based on which have the most significant improvement to the model.
  - **Backward Selection**: Starts with a full model that includes all predictors and removes the least significant variable one at a time.
  
After running the above code, you will get two fitted models. The output from the `summary` function will provide the coefficients of the model, including the intercept and slopes for each variable included in the final models.

### Writing the Model Equations
Suppose the output provides coefficients for `Height` and `Gender` in both models. The model equations would be something like:

- **Model 1 (Forward)**:
  \[ \text{Weight} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times \text{Height} + \beta_2 \times \text{Gender} + \epsilon \]
- **Model 2 (Backward)**:
  \[ \text{Weight} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times \text{Height} + \beta_2 \times \text{Gender} + \epsilon \]

### Comparison and Comment
- Compare the variables selected by both methods. Often, both forward and backward selections may end up with similar models when the dataset is not too large, and relationships between predictors and the response are straightforward.
- Discuss the fit of the models (e.g., R², adjusted R²) and how well each model might generalize to unseen data (using testing set).
- Note any discrepancies between the two methods regarding selected variables or coefficients, which could suggest areas of model sensitivity or robustness.

This detailed process allows you to carefully evaluate the impact of different variable selection methods on the predictive performance and interpretability of your regression models. Make sure to adjust the paths and possibly variable names according to your specific dataset and analysis setup in R.


c----

For part (c), we need to perform diagnostics checking for both of the fitted models (Model 1 from forward selection and Model 2 from backward selection). These checks are essential to validate the assumptions of linear regression, such as linearity, independence, homoscedasticity, and normality of residuals. Below, I'll provide the R code to create diagnostic plots for each model and discuss how to interpret these plots.

### R Code for Diagnostics Checking

Here's how you can set up your R environment to perform these diagnostic checks:

```r
# Load necessary library
library(car)  # For additional diagnostic plots, if necessary

# Diagnostics for Model 1 (Forward Selection Model)
par(mfrow=c(2,2))  # Set up the plotting area
plot(forward_model)  # Plot diagnostics

# Reset plot settings to default
par(mfrow=c(1,1))

# Diagnostics for Model 2 (Backward Selection Model)
par(mfrow=c(2,2))  # Set up the plotting area
plot(backward_model)  # Plot diagnostics

# Reset plot settings to default
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
```

### Explanation of Diagnostic Plots
1. **Residuals vs Fitted**: This plot helps check for non-linear patterns. Residuals should be randomly dispersed around the horizontal axis.
2. **Normal Q-Q**: This plot is used to examine if the residuals are normally distributed. Points should generally follow the line.
3. **Scale-Location (Spread-Location)**: This plot helps check for homoscedasticity (constant variance of residuals across the range of fitted values).
4. **Residuals vs Leverage**: This plot helps identify influential cases (outliers).

### Interpretation and Comments
- **Residuals vs Fitted**: You expect no clear pattern. If patterns are observed, it may suggest non-linearity in the data or that important predictors or transformations are missing.
- **Normal Q-Q**: Deviations from the straight line at the ends suggest potential outliers or leverage points. If the residuals are normally distributed, they should closely follow the reference line.
- **Scale-Location**: Ideally, the points should be evenly spread across the range of fitted values, indicating equal variance.
- **Residuals vs Leverage**: You are specifically looking for points outside the Cook’s distance lines or with high leverage that could unduly influence the model.

### Using Standardized Residuals
For standardized residuals, you often look for residuals beyond the (-2,2) range as potential outliers. You can customize your plots or add additional code to specifically focus on standardized residuals:

```r
# Calculate standardized residuals
forward_std_res <- rstandard(forward_model)
backward_std_res <- rstandard(backward_model)

# Plotting standardized residuals for Model 1
plot(forward_model$fitted.values, forward_std_res, ylim=c(-3,3), xlab="Fitted Values", ylab="Standardized Residuals")
abline(h=c(-2, 2), col="red")

# Plotting standardized residuals for Model 2
plot(backward_model$fitted.values, backward_std_res, ylim=c(-3,3), xlab="Fitted Values", ylab="Standardized Residuals")
abline(h=c(-2, 2), col="red")
```

### Comment on the Findings
The comment on the findings should include observations from the plots regarding each model's compliance with linear regression assumptions. Note any specific outliers, leverage points, or other anomalies that might affect the model’s validity or indicate a need for further model refinement or data transformation.


d-----

For part (d), we will use the two models developed from forward and backward selection methods to make predictions on the testing set and evaluate their performance using the root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP). We will then visualize the predictions against actual values to understand the model's accuracy visually.

### R Code for Prediction and RMSEP Calculation

```r
# Load necessary library
library(ggplot2)

# Make predictions using both models
predictions_forward <- predict(forward_model, newdata = testing)
predictions_backward <- predict(backward_model, newdata = testing)

# Calculate RMSEP for both models
rmsep_forward <- sqrt(mean((testing$Weight - predictions_forward)^2))
rmsep_backward <- sqrt(mean((testing$Weight - predictions_backward)^2))

# Print RMSEP values
print(paste("RMSEP for Forward Selection Model:", rmsep_forward))
print(paste("RMSEP for Backward Selection Model:", rmsep_backward))

# Plot of Predicted vs Actual values for both models
ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = testing$Weight, y = predictions_forward), color = "blue") +
  geom_point(aes(x = testing$Weight, y = predictions_backward), color = "red") +
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, linetype = "dashed", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Predicted vs Actual Weight",
       x = "Actual Weight (kg)",
       y = "Predicted Weight (kg)") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("blue", "red"), labels = c("Forward", "Backward")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.title = element_blank())
```

### Explanation and Output Interpretation
- **Predictions**: The `predict()` function is used to generate predictions from the models using the test set.
- **RMSEP Calculation**: RMSEP is calculated by taking the square root of the mean squared error (MSE) between the actual and predicted weight values. It provides a measure of the average magnitude of the prediction errors.
- **Plotting**: The plot displays the predicted values against the actual values for each model, with the ideal line (`y = x`) added for reference. Points from the forward selection are in blue, and from the backward selection are in red.

### Comment on Model Performance
- **RMSEP Values**: Lower RMSEP values indicate better model performance. Compare the RMSEP for the two models to see which one predicts more accurately on the test set.
- **Predicted vs Actual Plot**:
  - Ideal predictions would lie on the dashed line (`y = x`), indicating perfect agreement between predicted and actual values.
  - Scatter around this line indicates the variability in predictions, with tighter clusters around the line suggesting better model performance.
  - Observing whether one color (model) consistently lies closer to the line can help determine which model is more accurate.

### Comment
Based on the RMSEP values and the distribution of points in the plot, you can provide a comprehensive comment on:
- How well each model predicts actual weights.
- Which model appears to perform better and why.
- Any systematic errors observed in predictions (e.g., overpredictions or underpredictions at certain weight ranges).
- Implications for further model refinement or usage in practical scenarios.

This process not only quantifies the performance of each model but also visually inspects the adequacy and precision of the predictions, offering a holistic view of how these models might perform in real-world applications.
